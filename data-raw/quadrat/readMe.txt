All quadrat locations that were surveyed in 2018 are located in the 2018 folder. 
	note: If the original location for a quadrat was unsuitable in the year 2018 and a new quadrat was taken out in the field, that quadrat location is still location in the 2018 folder. In other words, quadrat locations that were never visited but originally mapped (perhaps outside a strip or in a wetland) are not in these folders.

In a couple of sites new quadrat locations were added for 2019 to replace old locations not being visited again...those new locations ONLY are located in the 2019 folder (i.e. those files don't repeat areas that will be revisited). 

Sites that were added for 2019 are only found in the 2019 folder.

Since no new strips were added in sites (only taken away) in 2019, the only sites in the 2019 strips folder are the completely new sites that were added. Even if strips weren't visited in 2019, the area & perimeter still exist in the 2018 folder.

Wat quadrat locations were added after staking in the field. 

8 quadrats locations were changed at MCN - those were updated in mcn_quadrats file in the 2019 folder

One quadrat location at SLO and POW needed to be taken again - the new locations replaced the old in their respective files in the 2018 folder. Original mapped locations can be found in the dropbox folder on Lydia's computer.
